    <h2>Introductory Python Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        The first 11 days were an introduction to python. During this time, the fundamentals of Python coding were introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Projects included random name generation, tip calculation, taking in user inputs, generating random strings from dictionaries, creating a Caesar Cipher, and a blackjack game.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was to build an understanding of functions, loops, and object-oriented programming. Please see below for a sample of the projects.
